It is part of a new system announced as perfected by the Western Electric Company and Warner Brothers Pictures Inc., by means of which complete musical programs, played by the world's greatest musical organizations, will be available in any moving picture theater. Absolute synchronization of films with reproduced sound having a naturalness never before attained is accomplished by the new system. The projector is no more complicated from the standpoint of operation than an ordinary moving picture projector. No special skill is required of the operator. If the film breaks, there is no interference with the accuracy of synchronization. A remarkable new electric reproducer is embodied in this part of the equipment."
